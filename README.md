dfNEW.xlsx is our dataset for Java. First 201 records are vulnerable methods. Remaining 408 are safe methods

SBertJSS.ipynb is used to generate the embeddings and similarity results using SBERT

code2vecJSS.ipynb  is used to generate the embeddings and similarity results using Code2vec

codeBertJSS.ipynb  is used to generate the embeddings and similarity results using CODEBERT

DecisionTree.ipynb file contains our decision tree based classifier

To calculate correctly-Classified Unique Instances in different Spaces, checkTestData and checkTestData-n3 files are used
